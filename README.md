# Intro To Unity + GitHub

On October 7, 2024 I attended the Video Game Development Club's Intro Unity + GitHub workshop. I went into the workshop with some experience with Unity mainly from CSE 165 3-D User Interaction where I explored using Unity's XR & AR toolkits with Meta's Oculus Quest 2.

The workshop started with installing GitHub Desktop in order to clone the repository needed for the workshop. The repository consisted of 2D game assets. We started with designing the level by utilizing sprites & the Sprite Renderer component to visual game objects. Next, we added a Rigidbody2D component to add physics & BoxCollider2D component to detect collisions on the game objects. Furthermore, we created a C# script & went over the Start() & Update() methods. Inside the Update() method I learned how to use Keycodes to read input from the user. As a result one of the C# script's functionality is to detect Keycodes to move the player's sprite. Also, we learned how to apply tags to game objects. As a result the C# script's other functionality is to detect collision & read tags to apply the appropriate game logic to the player's sprite. We ended with pushing and saving the project using GitHub Desktop.

In conclusion, I had no experience working with 2D games going into the workshop. However, I was able to learn how to use Unity to create a 2D platformer. My next steps after this is to make a 2D platformer with Unreal Engine.
